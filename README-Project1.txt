We collaborate to complete the project. We do not collaborate the project with anyone else.

*There are two java files in our ZIP. One is Project1.java and the other one is ProjectAirResistance.java. You can first see the Project1 for our project. ProjectAirResistance is only for the extra credit question that asks us to consider the the air resistance in the projectile, as we afraid that the equation we create under the air resistance condition is incorrect and affects the rest of code. The only difference between the two files is the equation for height. 

Description
This Project is a TTY game that asks the user to enter speed and angle for a projectile motion of a ball. There is a wall in front of the user. The distance of the wall to the user and the height of the wall is randomized by the computer within 1-20m, inclusively. In the beginning of our program, we define the variables required to do the computation of the projectile motion. To start the game, we ensure the user's score is above zero, thus the user get the quantification (each launch costs 1 point). Then We allow the user to choose whether they want to start a new round with new wall distance and height, stay in this round with previous wall distance and height, or quit the game. For the first try, the user cannot choose "Continue". 

If user enter "New", then the computer randomizes a new height h and distance x for wall, prompts the user to enter angle in degree and speed, and computes the height y of the ball when reaching the wall with the projectile-motion equation. By comparing the ball height y and wall height h, the computer gets into different if loop. There are several output sentences for each situation. If the user enter "Continue", then the computer keeps the height h and distance x for wall, prompts the user to enter angle in degree and speed, and computes the height y of the ball when reaching the wall with the projectile-motion equation. By comparing the ball height y and wall height h, the computer gets into different if loop. There are several output sentences for each situation. If the user enter "Quit" or anything else, the game ends. For each try, the score is displayed for the user. 

Besides, we create the moving wall. We record the time the user takes to enter the input and the projectile time before hitting the wall, then calculate the distance the wall moves during this time. The actual distance from the starting point of the ball to the wall when the ball reaches the wall is [original distance-(input time+projectile time)*wall speed]. Thus for each "Continue" try, the distance of the wall is reduced. 

Last but not least, we create a new equation for the projectile with air resistance. We change this equation by decreasing the quadratic coefficient. Hope this will work. This extra credit work shows in ProjectAirResistance.java. We create this new class with the changed equation; any other code does not change.
